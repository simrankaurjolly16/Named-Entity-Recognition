# Named-Entity-Recognition
NER is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

NER Systems
NER is a lively topic in NLP and the research efforts are evolved through the years. We can summarize these efforts in the following topics:
Classical Approaches (rule-based)
ML Approaches
Multi-class classification
Conditional Random Field (CRF)
3. DL Approaches
Bidirectional LSTM-CRF
Bidirectional LSTM-CNNs
Bidirectional LSTM-CNNS-CRF
Pre-trained language models (Elmo and BERT)
4. Hybrid Approaches (DL + ML)
